On occasion, you might need to have a flexible iframe in your website. Unfortunately, it's not quite as simple as creating an iframe and giving it a %-based width, but it can be done.

---

## Steps

1. Create the iframe as an inline instance of the iframe action. Set it to 100% width and to have a fixed height.

2. Configure the iframe via the actions window. Set it to be scrollable.

3. Right-click on the iframe action element. Click **Extended**.

4. In the `<div>` tab, add this entry:

	|  Name   |  Value  |
	|   - -   |   - -   |
	| `class` | `flexIframe` |

5. Dance! <(''<)  <( ' ' )>  (> '')>
