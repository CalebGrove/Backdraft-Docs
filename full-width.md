# Full-Width Elements in Backdraft

With the new full width wrapper module in Backdraft 2.0, creating full width sections of your website just got *too* easy.

---

## Steps

1. Hop over to the **Extra Modules** page and copy the full width wrapper from the bottom of the page.
2. Paste it as an inflow item directly onto a website page or master page (just like you would with any other module).
3. Style to taste! Adjust the background color, give it a background image, or even go all out with a [CSS3 gradient](http://actionsforge.com/actions/css3-gradients)!
4. Paste modules inside the full width wrapper.
5. As Walter Davis says, "There is no step 5".
