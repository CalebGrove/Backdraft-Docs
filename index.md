# What's New in Backdraft 2.0
----

After [Freeway 7 was released](http://www.softpress.com/freeway-pro/), we took a long hard look at Backdraft, what it was, and what it could be. Using FW7’s new features, we built what we believe is the easiest-to-use and most powerful version of Backdraft to date.

1. ### New

	* Modern header. This is a simple header with a navigation menu on top that is fixed to the top of the browser window. This uses the CSS Menus action.
	* Fixed header. This header is fixed to the top of the browser window, much like the one on [softpress.com](http://softpress.com). This uses the CSS Menus action.
	* Side-by-side header that places the navigation menu on the same line as the logo and title. This uses the CSS Menus action.
	* Full-width wrapper. Now it's even easier to create window-width backgrounds!

2. ### Improved

	* Backdraft now uses the Freeway’s new responsive functionality instead of hand-coded CSS wherever possible - thus making it much easier and quicker for you to customize and tweak the appearance at various breakpoints!
	* The “alternate” modules have been rebuilt with simpler construction.
	* All modules have been moved onto master pages. This will make your site’s publish faster and keep Backdraft HTML files and placeholder graphics from cluttering up your site folder.

3. ### Fixed

	* All the bugs!

4. ### Changed

	* **All graphics that need to be flexible width must now be imported as pass-through graphics!** This is due to a technical limitation of Freeway 7. Read the full article [here](flexible-graphics.html).

Go forth and make the web responsive!
