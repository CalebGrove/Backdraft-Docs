# Using Exhibeo 2 with Backdraft

[Exhibeo](http://exhibeoapp.com)Â is a very easy to use web gallery generator created by the folks at Softpress, which makes it easy to create responsive-friendly galleries for Freeway. In version 2, all of the themes are fully responsive and very easy to use.

----

1. Export the gallery from Exhibeo for Freeway with your desired settings.

2. Double-click inside the element that you want the gallery to appear in.

3. In the top-bar, choose Insert > Action Item > Exhibeo 2 Import.

4. Open the actions palette and choose the Exhibeo export file.

5. Open the inspector, and deactivate the width and the height fields. Although the gallery in Freeway's construction-view will collapse, if you preview the website in the browser the gallery will automatically expand to the correct size.
